Game info :

- 2 players take turns adding numbers, they have 4 options (check 0, add 1, add 2 and add 3)
- 2 random numbers are generated by the computer from 0 to 10 for each player
- The goal for each player is to add numbers and reach the number generated for them (min 0, max 10)
- At the begining of the game, the player who starts can check for 0 in case the generated number was 0
	- If the random number for the player who checked is in fact 0, he wins
	- If it isn't 0, the computer will automatically check for the 2nd player's random 	number, and if his number is 0, then he automatically wins the game! Oh noes!
- During the game players will take turns adding 1,2 or 3 for their sum. But if one player's sum (which is shown on the screen) becomes greater than the number generated for him/her, that player will automatically lose the game and the other will win
- If one player's sum becomes equal to the number generated for him, he wins the game.
- That's basically it, and since the functionality of the game is far from what it should be, I will kindly ask you to press the reset button once a player wins! PLEASE! DONT BREAK MY GAAAAME!

... (you'll break it won't you?)
